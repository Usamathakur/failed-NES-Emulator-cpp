# failed-NES-Emulator-cpp

## This is a failed attempt to make an NES emulator with the help of a guy on youtube named Javidx9

This project but thought me a lot about assembly how can you create an architecture how to plan a complex project. How to research for a perticular thing. How much time such a huge project requires and the knowledge gaps I have in my education. 

It has given me a headstart to my upcoming research. Thanks to Javidx9: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA for creating such an amazing content.
